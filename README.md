# Pokémon ML Battle Game 🎮

This project is a machine learning-based Pokémon battle simulator built with Python and Tkinter. It combines real data from a Pokémon dataset with a trained classification model to simulate battles between Pokémon based on their stats.

Note: This game is not a perfect or fully polished product. It is my first attempt at combining machine learning with a game using real-world data. There is definitely room for improvement such as adding more accurate battle mechanics, better balancing, and visual effects but it represents a strong foundation for learning and development.

## Machine Learning Model

A Gradient Boosting Classifier is trained on thousands of simulated battles, using real Pokémon stats such as:
- HP
- Attack
- Defense
- Special Attack
- Special Defense
- Speed

Each "match" compares two Pokémon and predicts which one would win based on their stats.

- Battle a wild, balanced opponent (based on total stat range)
- The trained ML model predicts the winner
- UI built with `Tkinter`
- Shows prediction confidence
- Stats are displayed for both Pokémon
